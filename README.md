# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Objective:
This project is designed to identify mobile app profiles that are profitable for both the App Store and Google Play markets.

The primary goal is to provide insights to our developers, aiding them in making informed decisions about the types of apps they design.

## Background:
